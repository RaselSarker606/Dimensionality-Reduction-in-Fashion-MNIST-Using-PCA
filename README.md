# Dimensionality-Reduction-in-Fashion-MNIST-Using-PCA
Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of input variables in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most commonly used methods for this purpose..

Dimensionality reduction is a powerful technique to visualize and analyze high-dimensional data. The Fashion-MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of clothing items, each represented by a 28x28 grayscale image, with 10 different classes.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a common method used for dimensionality reduction, which helps to identify the most important features in the data while preserving as much variance as possible.

Let's proceed with performing PCA on the Fashion-MNIST dataset:

Load the Fashion-MNIST Dataset: We'll load the dataset and preprocess it by flattening the images into vectors.

Normalize the Data: Normalize the pixel values to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the PCA.

Apply PCA: Perform PCA to reduce the dimensions to 2 or 3 for visualization purposes.

Visualize the Results: Plot the reduced dimensions to visualize the clusters formed by the different classes.
Steps to Apply PCA
Standardize the Data: PCA is sensitive to the variances of the variables, so itâ€™s important to standardize the data (mean = 0, variance = 1).

Compute the Covariance Matrix: The covariance matrix is used to understand the relationships between the variables.

Compute the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues: These are derived from the covariance matrix and are used to determine the principal components.

Select Principal Components: Choose the top k eigenvectors that correspond to the k largest eigenvalues.

Transform the Data: Project the data onto the selected principal components to get the reduced dimensional representation.
